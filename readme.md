# YouTubeExtractor

## Overview
YoutubeExtractor is a reusable library for .NET, written in C#, that allows to download videos from YouTube and/or extract their audio track (currently only for flash videos).

The original project, youtubeFisher, is a pure GUI application, but there was the need for a reusable library.

## Authors
All credits go to the [youtubeFisher](http://youtubefisher.codeplex.com/) project.

I, flagbug, just extracted the code out of this project, cleaned it up and packaged it into reusable classes.
